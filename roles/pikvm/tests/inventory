# Testing configuration, presently only tests the overrides. Where possible,
# defaults based on the vendor's documentation is used where possible and
# the override.yaml template will insert comments when defaults are used.
#
# One thing to note, while the TESmart 8-port and 16-port KVM switches may
# be used with any network-connected PiKVM, the ezCoo is controlled via a
# serial port connection so works only on Raspberry Pi 4 based PiKVMs or the
# PiKVM V4 Plus (sorry, ezCoo will neithr work with the Pi Zero 2 W nor will
# it work with the V4 Mini as neither have a usable USB port for control.
#
# I've tested all 5 working KVM switch configurations, two for TESmart with
# implicit (default) settings and explicit settings, and three for ezCoo
# with protocol and device implicit and explicit values tested independently
# as all of the settings used match my devices.
#
# Not all possible use cases are tested yet as the ones here are my primary
# use cases for configuration and customization.
