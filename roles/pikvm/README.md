pikvm
=========

The pikvm role contains files, templates, and tasks to perform initial installation and configuration tasks as well as maintain both the configuration and security baselines of one or more PiKVM hosts. 

Requirements
------------

The collection community.general is a requirement, this may or may not be installed depending on whether your control host is using ansible or ansible-core. This role has been written and tested with Ansible Core version 2.15.

Role Variables
--------------

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

Dependencies
------------

A list of other roles hosted on Galaxy should go here, plus any details in regards to parameters that may need to be set for other roles, or variables that are used from other roles.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
